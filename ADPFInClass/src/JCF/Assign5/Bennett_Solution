a. The main problem I have ran into is that both threads are
requesting information at the same time, which may cause them to
overlap one another and make it hard or impossible to input items and their prices
correctly!

b. one way to fix this problem is by giving a lock to the Walmart class
which will be used by each cashiers to get their items and prices one Cashier at a time
This Lock is public

c. Another issue is that it is possible that the use of walmart may overlap with the use in other cashiers
this may cause price miss matches and or a incorrect item count

d. To fix this, I gave walmart a second lock that was private, named inner lock
This lock guarantees that there is no overlap in the class.
furthermore, I use the outer lock again, within the inner lock so to insure printing
totals does not interrupt the system
